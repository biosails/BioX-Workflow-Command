=head1 Quick Start

=head2 Get Help

  #Global Help
  biox --help
  biox-workflow.pl --help
  #Help Per Command
  biox run --help

=head2 Run a Workflow

  #Previously biox-workflow.pl --workflow workflow.yaml
  biox run -w workflow.yml #or --workflow
  biox-workflow.pl run --workflow workflow.yml

=head2 Run a Workflow with make like utilities


Using the option --auto_deps will create #HPC deps based on your INPUT/OUTPUTs -
use this with caution. It will only work correctly if INPUT/OUTPUT is complete
and accurate.

  biox run --workflow workflow.yml --auto_deps


=head2 Create a new workflow

This creates a new workflow with rules rule1, rule2, rule3, with a few variables
to help get you started.

  biox new -w workflow.yml --rules rule1,rule2,rule3

=head2 Add a new rule to a workflow

Add new rules to an existing workflow.

  biox add -w workflow.yml --rules rule4

=head2 Check the status of files in your workflow

You must have defined INPUT/OUTPUTs to make use of this rule. If you do, biox
will output a table with information about your files.

  biox stats -w workflow.yml

=head1 DESCRIPTION
