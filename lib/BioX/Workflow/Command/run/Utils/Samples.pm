=head2 Variables

=head3 resample

Boolean value get new samples based on indir/sample_rule or no

Samples are found at the beginning of the workflow, based on the global indir variable and the file_find.

Chances are you don't want to set resample to true. These files probably won't exist outside of the indirectory until the pipeline is run.

One example of doing so, shown in the gemini.yml in the examples directory, is looking for uncompressed files, .vcf extension, compressing them, and
then resampling based on the .vcf.gz extension.

=cut

has 'resample' => (
    isa       => 'Bool',
    is        => 'rw',
    default   => 0,
    predicate => 'has_resample',
    clearer   => 'clear_resample',
);

=head3 sample_files

Infiles to be processed

=cut

has 'sample_files' => (
    is  => 'rw',
    isa => 'ArrayRef',
);

=head2 by_sample_outdir

    outdir/
    /outdir/SAMPLE1
        /rule1
        /rule2
        /rule3
    /outdir/SAMPLE2
        /rule1
        /rule2
        /rule3

Instead of

    /outdir
        /rule1
        /rule2

    documentation => q{When you want your output by sample},
    clearer       => 'clear_by_sample_outdir',
    predicate     => 'has_by_sample_outdir',
);

=head3 samples

Our samples to process. They are either found through sample_rule, or passed as command line opts

=cut

=head3 sample

Each time we get the sample we set it.

=cut

has 'sample' => (
    is        => 'rw',
    isa       => 'Str',
    required  => 0,
    default   => '',
    predicate => 'has_sample',
);

=head2 Subroutines

=head3 get_samples

Get basename of the files. Can add optional rules.

sample.vcf.gz and sample.vcf would be sample if the sample_rule is (.vcf)$|(.vcf.gz)$

Also gets the full path to infiles

Instead of doing

    foreach my $sample (@$self->samples){
        dostuff
    }

Could have

    foreach my $infile (@$self->infiles){
